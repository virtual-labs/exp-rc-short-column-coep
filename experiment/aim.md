### Aim 
To design a safe and efficient reinforced concrete (RC) short column subjected to both axial compression (direct force) and uniaxial bending (bending about one axis).

### Objective
-  Determine the combined effect of axial load and bending moment on the column's capacity.
-  Design the column section and reinforcement to resist the applied loads while ensuring strength and serviceability.
-  Satisfy all relevant code requirements for short column design under combined axial and flexural loads.
