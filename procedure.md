## PROCEDURE

### Configuration:
-	Configure the parameters such as working load (KN), grade of concrete, grade of steel, unsupported length l<sub>x</sub> (m), unsupported length 
	l<sub>y</sub> (m) and support conditions.
-	Proceed to the next step by clicking on the next arrow.
-	Calculate factored load (P<sub>u</sub>), effective lengths lx<sub>eff</sub> and ly<sub>eff</sub> in mm. After three incorrect attempts, correct formula and value will be    displayed.
-	Proceed to the next step by clicking on the next arrow.
 
### Calculations:
-   Assume and enter the value of A<sub>sc</sub> within the range of 0.8% to 6% as per IS 456:2000, Clause 26.5.3.1 a. Values of A<sub>g</sub>,
	A<sub>c</sub> and A<sub>sc</sub>  will be displayed.
-	Select the type of column. Proceed to the next step by clicking on the next arrow.
-	Enter the value of b/D ratio. After clicking on submit button, checks for short column and axially loaded column along with dimensions of column are displayed.
-	Proceed to the next step by clicking on the next arrow.
-	Enter the diameter of longitudinal bar which should be more than or equal to 12 mm as per IS 456:2000, Clause 26.5.3.1 d.
